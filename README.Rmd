# partition.benchmark

The goal of `partition.benchmark` is to benchmark the `partition` package. It contains four benchmarking functions: `benchmark_kmeans()`, `benchmark_partition()`, `benchmark_all()`, and `benchmark_and_save()`. The first two benchmark the functions directly, while the third benchmarks both and returns a combined dataframe, and the fourth calls `benchmark_all()` and saves the data internally as `benchmarks`.

You can plot them with `plot_benchmarks()`. The default is to plot `benchmarks`, but you can use a different data set or filter `benchmarks`.

```{r, dpi = 320, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(partition.benchmark)
plot_benchmarks()
```
